<h1>This is a study of the color theary of Cyberpunk 2077 and the affect it has on the gameplay</h1>
<p>Cyberpunk explore the ideas of Jean Baudrillard’s theories on how simulation and hyperreality can enhance the gameplay. The narrative created in the story by dialogue and story can change the players perceptions of the world and blur the line between simulation and reality. The games realism contributes to how immersive the game can be. The game itself feels real while lacking some of reality but removes itself from reality while blurring the lines between reality and simulation.<p>

<h2>Effect of color imagery </h2>
<p>The color palette of Cyberpunk 2077 is comprised of many grays and darker color tones while included bright tones creating a contrast in the environment. The darker tones help create much of the dirty city imagery while the brighter bold colors help tie into the futuristic more industrialized society. Cyberpunk has created an interesting perspective for the player to be immersed within. The aesthetic of cyberpunk in undoubtably futurism but contains an aspect far from what is normally seen in ideas of the future. Much like the movie Bladerunner it creates a grungy vision of the future. The scenes are riddled with trash and dilapidated areas. The use of color within the game helps create a high contrast between the areas of grunge and the advancement of technology. The colors in the game help create similarities to megacities in our current time period like New York or Tokyo. This helps the player feel the effect of the similarities between reality and the game, creating feelings of how imperfect the future is. The game uses colors very well to illustrate the struggle of everyday life and many of the problems that afflict the interactions within the game..</p>

<p>In the game the players find themselves in the world of night city. Night city shares many similarities and differences to the real world creating a simulation to the player. This connects to Barthes “the Reality effect” as the game helps create an authentic and plausible reality. The game creates an illusion through high detail, narrative, and materiality in the game. The cyber punk world is rather a simulation of reality that can be explored. </p>
