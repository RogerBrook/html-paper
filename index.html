<h2>Effect of color imagery </h2>
<p>The color palette of Cyberpunk 2077 is comprised of many grays and darker color tones while included bright tones creating a contrast in the environment. The darker tones help create much of the dirty city imagery while the brighter bold colors help tie into the futuristic more industrialized society. Cyberpunk has created an interesting perspective for the player to be immersed within. The aesthetic of cyberpunk in undoubtably futurism but contains an aspect far from what is normally seen in ideas of the future. Much like the movie Bladerunner it creates a grungy vision of the future. The scenes are riddled with trash and dilapidated areas. The use of color within the game helps create a high contrast between the areas of grunge and the advancement of technology. The colors in the game help create similarities to megacities in our current time period like New York or Tokyo. This helps the player feel the effect of the similarities between reality and the game, creating feelings of how imperfect the future is. The game uses colors very well to illustrate the struggle of everyday life and many of the problems that afflict the interactions within the game..</p>
